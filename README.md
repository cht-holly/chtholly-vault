## Why We Built This

Smart crypto holders spread their assets across multiple wallets for security - hardware wallets, exchanges, DeFi protocols, and cold storage. But this creates a massive problem: **how do you track your total portfolio value?**

Most solutions require you to connect wallets or share personal data. That's a privacy nightmare and security risk we're not willing to take.

**Chtholly Vault solves this by letting you track everything locally on your device. No wallet connections, no personal data, no compromises.**

## What It Does

### ‚úÖ Complete Privacy
- **Local storage only** - all data stays on your device
- **No wallet addresses required** - just add your holdings manually
- **Zero tracking** - no analytics, cookies, or data collection
- **No backend servers** - client-side only application

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Portfolio Tracking
- **Live cryptocurrency prices** from CoinGecko API
- **Multi-currency support** - view in USD, SGD, or MYR
- **Portfolio analytics** - track performance, profit/loss, and market changes
- **Consolidated view** - see your total value across all wallets

### ‚úÖ Smart Features
- **Easy data management** - export/import your holdings
- **Customizable refresh rates** - control how often prices update
- **Clean, modern interface** - built for crypto investors
- **Mobile responsive** - track on any device

---

## How It Works

1. **Add Your Holdings** - Manually input your cryptocurrency holdings (coin + quantity)
2. **Get Live Prices** - Automatic price updates from CoinGecko API
3. **Track Performance** - See your total portfolio value and individual asset performance
4. **Stay Private** - Everything stored locally, nothing leaves your device

No wallet connections. No personal data. Just clean, private portfolio tracking.
